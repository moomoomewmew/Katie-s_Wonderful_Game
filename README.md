#### There are two players: black and red. 

Rules: 
* Red starts the game
* Each player can move 1 square diagonally left or right
*jump over your opponents checkers to remove them from the board.
*the first player to the other side wins!

#### GOAL: remove all of your opponents pieces from the board.
