## How It Works
***
#### There are two players: black and red. 

#### Rules: 
* Red starts the game
* Each player can move 1 square diagonally left or right
* Jump over your opponents checkers to remove them from the board.
* The first player to the other side wins!

#### GOAL: Get to the other side of the board.

## How To Get It
***
1. Fork
2. Clone
3. Enjoy

***
## Things to improve upon
***
1. I need to place pictures in the README file.
2. I need to work on the winning conditions, as they are just notes at this point.
3. This game needs a replay option.
4. The game logic could be expanded with the "king" rule.
5. The new winning conditions after adding the king rule would be that there is only 1 color token left on the board.
